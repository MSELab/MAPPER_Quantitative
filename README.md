# MAPPER Quantitative Drosophila wing analysis pipeline
This is a repository for the Multicellular Analysis Platform for Engineering Research (MAPPER) Drosophila wing analysis pipeline developed by [Nilay Kumar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XZjD7PYAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) within the [Multicellular Systems Engineering Lab](http://sites.nd.edu/zartmanlab/) at the University of Notre Dame. Please direct any questions to the lab principal investigator, [Dr. Jeremiah Zartman](http://sites.nd.edu/zartmanlab/contacts/). 

[Here](https://github.com/MSELab/MAPPER_Quantitative/tree/main/MAPPER_v1.0.0) is a link to the main code to run the application. Running this application does require [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html). A full instructional manual can be found within the supplementary information of the manuscript text.

# Future Additions
1. Instructional training videos
2. Include a link to the published manuscript to review the supplementary information
3. Include additional wing features
